Platoon stablitiy test on classes of vehicles.
Look at string instability of entire simulation.
    by plotting space time graphs and doing the math?
    Add capability for space time diagrams
Think about starting from equilibrium spacing
    need to incorporate code that allows starting from uniform spacing
Length of road as function of number of cars and equilibrium spacing analysis -> Ns*? 
    need to change length of road as function of cars and equilibrium spacing
Platoon Stability analysis and get speed at which platoon is stable
    math and data from sim needed
Make velocity time graphs for all vehicles
    -> analyze the results for different AV models
Control experiment lane change dynamics in SUMO
Relu on flow?
Clustering explation: distribution -> the more uniform distribution at start up the more clustering is

Wording:
Our software allows simulations that contain both learning agents (autonomous vehicles) and vehicles with pre-specified controllers or dynamics. This permits the use of Flow for mixed autonomy experiments.
