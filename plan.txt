#========= Sim set up ===========

(DONE) Car distribution: 100 HVs, 1 AV
(DONE) AV Behavior initially: Baseline HV Like

Simulation terminates when:
(DONE) AV makes 10 cycles 

Implement Reinforcement Learning Regime 1:
-> optimize P(lc)
-> reward fastest time taken to finish (record sim time)
-> allow AV to change its own P(lc)

Implement Reinforcement Learning Regime 2:
-> optimize v
-> penalize if speed less than average speed
-> allow AV to change its own v_max

============== PLAN =============
1) think of simulation scheme (state, actions, rewards, termination, outputs)
2) implement changes to current software to incorporte Qlearning
3) use VI to populate Qtable
4) get results
5) learn CNN and Deep Qlearning
6) change VI to NN system
