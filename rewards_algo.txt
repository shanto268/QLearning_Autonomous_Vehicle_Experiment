bare bones reward model:
step function would take action as input
    if action results in collision end sim -> high penalty
    if action leads to empty block and safe -> good reward
    if action leads to safety and better v_potential -> highest reward
    if action leads to not changing lane and lane change was not possible -> good rew    ard

need to do!
    for each cycle, c, record time taken, t.
        rewards += constant * ( cycle_distance / t)
        -> this would incentivize agent to increase its average speed more
        -> this would also make sure that it completes more cycles
